What I have so far......
	***	Views-	Home, Game Libiary, Detail
	***	Model-	BoardGame
	***	Controllers- HomeController
	*** Data- BoardGameRepository
			game data hard coded in repository
	*** This txt file

My understanding/explaination of the pieces in play.

Home controller handles all incomming request. 

Constructor() upon creation this creates a new BoardGameRepository

Action Methods- they do things
	ActionResult Index() - returns the Index View, located in Views/Home/Index
	ViewResult GameLibrary() - 
			creates var boardGames = from gameRepo.GetGames()
			var boardGames no has all boardgame
			boardgames is passed to  game library view.
			Game Library view loops each element in var bardGames and displays Title

	ActionResult Detail(int? id) - 
			-careats a var called BoardGame, calls GetBoardGame, passes piticular
			BoardGame to the Detail View creating dynamic Detail View based upon game link clicked?

Data - Repository
	
	Methods -
	Constructor - creates an array of BoardGame objects, hard coded.
		
		public BoardGame[] GetBoardGames()
				this returns _boardGames that was created upon construction.  
				
		public BoardGame GetBoardGame(int id)
				this
			
		
		Home controller constructs null _gameRepository ----> gameRepository constructor adds hard coded data into an array called _boardGames.

Model- BoardGame
	string GetTitle() - not actually useful now. redundent.




As of now Index.cshtml is our home page.
