------------------Data/Models/Repository---------------------------
BoardGame Model/class
Repository that creates an array of hard coded game titles and attributes.


Board Game Companion App.
Phase 1)
1. Game Library List: sorting, quereys
2. BoardGame - Displays info of specific Title( player ct, rating, play time,  play logging
            Game Libirary data hard coded.  Only one List/User.
            
Phase 2)            
1. Clean up HTML
2. Multi List/User log-ins?  Now idea how user log-ins work yet....could be too much too soon.
3. Add titles from drop down or search bank?   *Game info still hard coded.

Phase 3)
1.  Learn ****SQL**** and SQL .net intragretion. 
    Upload Game Titles to server.
    Search Server for title.
    Add to list from server.
    Save List to server.
    Probably some more user log-in stuff.  
    *****No idea how indepth or advanced this is.

Phase 4)
1. Board Game Geek API
    https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2
    This should tell me how to use BGG data from their servers?
    ****Know nothing about this******* with a api it shouldent be too hard?  Make direct calls to BGG servers instead of scraping
    Im not even sure I know is the line above has any validity or if its just what i think is the internet workings.
    
2. One BoardGameGeek api can be used to find titles......pull data
